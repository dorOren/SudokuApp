# SudokuApp
A Sudoku game app that can generate random boards to play with, and has a solver mode that can solve a given, not full board typed by the user using a back-tracking recursive algorithm.

I created this project using some of the knowledge I gained in:
- C#	
- WinForms
- Git & Github

Thank you for your time 😁
